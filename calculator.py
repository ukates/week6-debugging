    # fill in code here that:
    #   1. checks the second number to see if it is zero
    #   2. if the second number is zero, an exception is raised, the exception text must say exactly the following (make sure everything including casing and spaces match)
    #       I'm sorry, I can't divide by zero
    #   3. returns the quotient of first and second
